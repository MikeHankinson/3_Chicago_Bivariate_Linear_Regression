# 3_Chicago_Bivariate_Linear_Regression

## Project: Linear Regression (Bivariate)

### Skills and Tools

1. Utilize method of moments to develop a sophisticated comprehension of the slope and intercept parameters from a bivariate linear model.
2.  Evaluate bivariate linear model parameters and goodness of fit through the use of t-statistics, confidence intervals, and R-squared calculation.
3. Define the assumptions of linear regression, and explore how potential violations can be identified and subsequently correct perform hypothesis testing on linear model results.

     * Interperate Bivariate Linear Regression
     * Evaluate Bivariate Linear Regression
     * Assumptions of the Linear Model
     * Correlation vs. Causation

### Context
Having an inadequate sample size or a lack of explanatory variables are often hindrances to performing successful analyses. However, having access to an excessive amount of data can often be an issue as well. When examining data sets with a large number of variables, it can be difficult to uncover patterns within the data set and select a combination of predictors that will identify meaningful signals.

Use this PCA technique to reduce the number of variables needed for modeling.

### Problem Statement
Perform Principal Component Analysis to analyze the exercise performance variables in an athlete dataset.
   * Produce a correlation matrix of the variables.
   * Perform PCA and analyze the VAF by each factor. Include an elbow plot.
   * Interpret the first loading using loadings plot.
   * Use a bi plot of the first two factors and loadings and/or other visualizations to identify unique individuals.
